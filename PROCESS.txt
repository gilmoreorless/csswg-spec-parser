=== PARSE ALL SPECS ===

Open CSSWG "current work" page
Look for stable(ish) specs (REC, CR, PR)
For each URL:
  Parse spec page [see elsewhere]
  Compare shorthand properties [see elsewhere]
  Compare animatable properties [see elsewhere]


=== PARSE SPEC PAGE ===

Open URL
For each propdef table
  Get property name
  Get property value syntax
  If computed value is 'see individual properties'
    Flag it as shorthand property
    Find the paragraph element after the propdef table, as it might contain longhand details
  If animatable property (but not a shorthand), try to get animatable details
    Parse animatable text description, find animation types & details (e.g. repeatable)
  If property is "interesting" (shorthand or animatable), process it
    If shorthand property, attempt to find longhand values
      If property is known in css-shorthand-properties
        Just use the known longhand values (as they're likely to be more accurate than the parser)
        Add it to shorthand list with known longhands
      Otherwise, if it's an unknown shorthand
        Find properties referenced in propdef's value syntax
        Find properties referenced in description paragraph
        Add it to shorthand list with combined detected longhands
    If shorthand property, add it to animatable list (as shorthand with empty longhand list)
    If animatable (but not shorthand), add it to animatable list
Return shorthand and animatable lists


=== COMPARE SHORTHAND PROPERTIES ===

For each parsed spec page
  For each shorthand property
    Find the property's longhands in css-shorthand-properties
    Normalise the parsed longhands by expanding any nested shorthands
    If the two longhand lists don't match, mark property as DIFFERING
  For each differing property
    (Just logs the longhands for manual verification right now)
    ~-=FUTURE=-~
      Open css-shorthand-properties source (if it's not already open)
      Add a line to the data list with the new shorthands
~-=FUTURE=-~
  If all differing properties have been added, show a source diff for manual verification


=== COMPARE ANIMATABLE PROPERTIES ===

For each parsed spec page
  For each animatable property, mark it as matching existing definitions (yes/no)
    Find the property's details in css-animated-properties
    If no details are found, mark as NOT MATCHING
    If known types and parsed types differ, mark as NOT MATCHING
    If property is a shorthand and the known and parsed longhands differ
      If parsed longhands are missing, use known ones and mark as MATCHING
      Otherwise, mark as NOT MATCHING
  For each differing (non-matching) property
    (Just logs the definitions for manual verification right now)
    ~-=FUTURE=-~
      Open css-animated-properties source (if it's not already open)
      Add a line to the data list with the new shorthands
~-=FUTURE=-~
  If any differing properties have been added, show a source diff for manual verification
